In case of testing for scientific domain specific model, you should initilize the vocab dictionaries with values from:
w2i.txt. This file already contains the dict and word serial numbers, so no need for the whole corpus, upon vocabulary initialization.

You need the model file itself: adam_batch_bilstm_bigmodel2.txt
You can download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5iAITPoL9L2ald0VzNxZWtxdGM/view?usp=sharing

Otherwise, for any other domain or corpora you please replace long30k.txt filename in the code with your own training text file.
You should also uncomment the reading of the file in code, and comment the vocabulary initialization.

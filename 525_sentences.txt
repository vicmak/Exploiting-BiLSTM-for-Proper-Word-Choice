A memory based approach computes recommendations directly *over/from the raw data – typically a user-item ratings matrix
Model based *approaches/methods construct statistical models – summarizations of the raw data – that allow the system to answer online requests very rapidly
Computing models that provide high quality recommendations may also require *significant/substantial computation resources.
Since recommendation services *must/should be inexpensive, a recommender system provider must be able to support many clients to be profitable
Such an approach, however, entails significant effort and investment and can result in inaccurate pricing estimations since the accuracy level might be different for *different/diverse datasets.

For example in the direct marketing scenario, a binary classifier can be used to classify potential customers as to *weather/whether they will positively or negatively respond to a particular marketing offer.
A multiclass classification task is essentially more *challengeable/challenging than a binary classification task, since the induced classifier must classify the instances into a larger number of classes, which also increases the likelihood for misclassification.
In order to classify a new instance *in/into one of the three classes, we first obtain the binary classification from each of the base classifiers.
There are several *motivations/reasons for using decomposition tactics in multiclass solutions.
In *that/such cases it is preferable to count the "against" votes, instead of counting the "for" votes since there is a greater chance of making a mistake when counting the latter.
In such cases it is preferable to count the "against" votes, instead of counting the "for" votes *because/since there is a greater chance of making a mistake when counting the latter.
Thus, even multiclass induction algorithms may benefit from converting the problem *in/into a set of binary tasks.
In order to achieve this, column separation is also demanded, that is, the Hamming distance *among/between each pair of columns of vector M must be high.

Sivalingam et al.  propose transforming a multiclass recognition problem into a minimal binary classification problem using the minimal classification method (MCM) aided *with/by error-correcting codes.
Another interesting feature of RECOCs, *pointed/noted by the authors, is that they allow a regulated degree of randomness in their design.
*Like/As in channel coding theory, a puncturing mechanism can be used to prune the dependence among the binary classifiers in a code-matrix.
Since the implemented GA also aims to minimize the ensemble size, the code-matrices are tailor-made *to/for each multiclass problem.
In the face of this continually expanding interest in exploiting available datasets, we have seen over the past 10 years increased attention in privacy-preserving data mining, a field which tries to provide a tradeoff between *keeping/maintaining privacy and using the private data.
An external researcher is interested in using this database in order to generate a model with the aim of *inducing/introducing a new treatment protocol.
For example, if there is only a single patient in the database who is 90 years old, then providing the age datum *may/could reveal the identity of this patient.
she managed to find medical information *of/about the governor of Massachusetts.
The resultant anonymous dataset can then be sent to an external user *that/who may utilize any induction algorithm for training a classifier over the anonymous dataset.
In this *article/paper, we assume that suppression is used on the non-complying node only where we prune the leaf node of the non-complying node, thus suppressing all the attribute values which are associated with that node.
If all the leaves in the tree are complying nodes, *than/then we can say that that the dataset complies with k-anonymity.
The same swapping process as described above is applied *on/to the selected record.
*It/This means that we need to count all the instances of its child nodes.
But the accuracy of kACTUS-2 converges to the accuracy of TDS for k = 1000, while the classification accuracy of kACTUS *gets/becomes  worse than kADET starting from about k = 700 and starting from about k = 900 with TDS.
In this *research/paper we introduce the root-cause problem and define different types of failure.
Note that some machines may *appear/operate in more than one step in the process.
We *classify/place a failure in this category if it was due to a specific problem in one or more of the machines on the manufacturing floor.
Using the queues with a predefined size *donates/denotes the important feature of this data structure.
We can also refer to *those/these merging scenarios as the edges in our weighting function, giving them the highest and the lowest scores.
*on/In the next section, Evaluation, we examine different threshold values in order to find the optimal value. 
Furthermore, in real-life, defects can *come/arise from different sources at a time, multi- classifications, creating more than one problematic root-cause.
Adding a virtual cluster, where the distance to it always equals the manufacturing route dimensions, will achieve the required balance by *uprising/increasing the minimal cost to 4 instead of 1.
In each of the three experiments where the sliding window was the same, we can *notice/see a better performance from those experiments where the Squeezer acceptance threshold matched their queue size.
 We observed the model performance and accuracy, *outlining/observing very good performances when tackling Single machine, Specific failure and many machines, each with a specific failure and moderate performance when trying to solve many machines, process combination failure type.
 However, these performances can be further improved *in/at the expense of increasing the number of scraps till discovery measurement.
 In order to achieve these *great/impressive results we adjust the parameters/thresholds by implementing an approach where we increase  the queue size and Squeezer acceptance threshold while preserving the special ratio between them.
 The reason for *that/this lies with the increase of the queue size parameter which causes the model to further investigate the “past”, reducing misclassification and increasing the accuracy.
However, as mentioned before, this *great/high level performance usually comes at the expense of increasing the number of scraps till discovery measurement.
In addition, tackling a situation without prior knowledge *on/about the probabilities for each failure type will require a general integrated approach.
 One, called sensitivity component, will be responsible for sensitivity and fast reaction to any new root cause, while the other, called accuracy component, will be responsible mainly *on/for discovering Many machines, process combination failure types and on enhancing the performance.
As mentioned *before/above, we compare performances using five related scrap intervals.
 However, as *mentioned/noted above, this comes at the cost of preserving accuracy.
The methodology consists of three main stages: first, updating the model with each new instance and its classification; second, if the instance classified as scrap, common failures are then clustered using the Squeezer categorical clustering algorithm; and finally, determining for each cluster *if/whether it can be a root-cause or not.
The new evaluation method can be easily adjusted *to/for use with the known measurements, confusion matrix and ROC to compare and analyze .
